However, keeping his skills hidden becomes more difficult as dungeon-related incidents pile up around him.When Jin-Woo and a few other low-ranked hunters are the only survivors of a dungeon that turns out to be a bigger challenge than initially expected, he draws attention once again, and hunter guilds take an increased interest in him.
