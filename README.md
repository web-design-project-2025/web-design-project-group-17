# **RE:VIEW – Anime Review Web**

*This is not a fully developed website, but a project where the website is supposed to emulate a real website as well as possible, with our current skills.
*Images taken from the web, & taken from especially MyAnimeList, and we take no ownership or revenue from this at all, this is for our educational purposes only.

RE:VIEW is a minimally designed website, with the purpose of showcasing animes and reviews by yourself and others. 
Developed by Group 17, as a part of Web Design Project 2025, this platform offers users an engaging and aesthetic interface where users can discover anime through information, user reviews, and keep track of your own favourites.
